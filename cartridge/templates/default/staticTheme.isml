This template is a list of static content in a format similar to what would be returned from BloomReach servers.  This was used
for testing BloomReachTheme-Fetch before content was returned by the BloomReach CDN.  This can be used for diagnostics by a client.
It is generated by passing 'usestatic' as a URL parameter to BloomReachTheme-Fetch.
